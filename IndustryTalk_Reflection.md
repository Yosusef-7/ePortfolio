# Reflection: Industry Talk 2 (Project Management & System Development)

### a. What I gained
From the talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim of Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd, I learned that technical coding skills alone are not enough for a successful career. The speaker highlighted the "three-year struggle" many graduates face because they lack project management skills. I gained a deeper understanding of the Halal ecosystem and how crucial it is to plan, document processes, and understand the architectural scope of a project before writing code. "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."

### b. Suggested Improvement
While the talk was very insightful regarding career advice, it would have been beneficial to see a live demonstration of the actual "Halal verification system" interface. Seeing the code structure or the software in action would help bridge the gap between the theoretical project management advice and real-world technical application.

### c. My Opinion & Creativity
I found the session highly motivating because it shifted my mindset from thinking like a student to thinking like a professional developer. My creative takeaway is to start treating every university assignment as a "professional deliverable" by integrating proper documentation and workflow planning immediately. This strategy will help me build discipline and avoid the common pitfalls fresh graduates face in the industry.
