# Reflection: PC Assembly Lab

### a. What I gained
The mission of this lab was to practice handling computer hardware in a real-world setting. I learned how to correctly identify, disassemble, and reassemble key components such as the Motherboard, CPU, and RAM. Although I already had theoretical knowledge about these parts, the hands-on experience of physically removing and installing them gave me a much deeper understanding of the safety precautions and precision required.

### b. Suggested Improvement
To improve this lab session, I suggest using more modern hardware components or including a specific section on "Cable Management." Dealing with the cables is often the hardest part of building a PC, and learning the industry standards for neat cabling would be very beneficial.

### c. My Opinion & Creativity
I found this experiment to be a great learning opportunity. Even though I knew the concepts beforehand, applying them practically made a huge difference. It made me realize that Computer Science is not just about coding; understanding the physical hardware limits and architecture is essential for becoming a well-rounded IT professional.
