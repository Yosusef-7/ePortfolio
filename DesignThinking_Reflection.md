# Reflection: Design Thinking (Project SpaceSync)

### a. What I gained
Through the "SpaceSync" project, I strengthened my problem-solving abilities by leading the **Define and Ideate** stages. I learned how to use tools like the "5-Whys Analysis" to identify that the root cause of student anxiety was not a lack of space, but a lack of information. This process helped me structure my ideas effectively and motivated me to enhance my technical knowledge for future projects.

### b. Suggested Improvement
During our testing phase, users (Staff) suggested that the logic for finding tables could be smarter. A major improvement would be integrating an **Artificial Intelligence (AI) recommendation engine** that suggests the best study spot based on the student's specific needs (e.g., group size or quiet zone), rather than just showing a map.

### c. My Opinion & Creativity
I found the creative process of "Reframing the Problem" to be the most impactful part of this assignment. Instead of suggesting expensive physical buildings, we used divergent thinking to create a digital solution (IoT Sensors + App). This shifted my perspective on how to solve real-world campus problems using existing technology efficiently.
